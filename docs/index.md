# Clustably

Clustably provides simple resampling methods for determining the stability of single-cell RNA-Seq clusters. It is mainly aimed at use together with [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/), however the methods here can be generalized to other packages and even data types.

A tutorial vignette can be found [here](JackknifeResampling.html).
